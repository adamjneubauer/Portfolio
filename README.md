The scope of this project was to develop a basic portfolio containing a contact form, a bio page, and portfolio of images that will be updated at a later date when more projects are completed. The three pages all link to eachother and contain bootstrap CSS elements that change in layout for different media screen sizes. This is an ongoing project that will continue to be updated as I complete more projects and my skills improve.
